When we deal with a text document, we encounter different forms of a word. Consider the word "play".
This word can appear in various forms, such as "play", "plays", "player", "playing", and so on. These are
basically families of words with similar meanings. During text analysis, it's useful to extract the base
form of these words. This will help us in extracting some statistics to analyze the overall text. The goal
of stemming is to reduce these different forms into a common base form. This uses a heuristic process to
cut off the ends of words to extract the base form.
