# Stemming
When we deal with a text document, we encounter different forms of a word. Consider the word "play". This word can appear in various forms, such as "play", "plays", "player", "playing", and so on. These are basically families of words with similar meanings. The goal of stemming is to reduce these different forms into a common base form.
